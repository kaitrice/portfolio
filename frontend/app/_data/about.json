    "bio": "I'm a full stack developer with hands-on experience building responsive web apps, scalable APIs, and data-driven solutions. Since 2017, I've honed my skills through personal projects, freelance work, and professional roles, gaining expertise in frontend frameworks like React, Next, and Angular, backend development with Node.js and Python, and database design and optimization using PostgreSQL and MySQL.\n\nMy work spans interactive websites, real-time IoT systems, and e-commerce platforms. I've implemented CI/CD pipelines, deployed cloud-based services, and optimized both front-end performance and backend data workflows. Beyond coding, I enjoy designing intuitive user interfaces, uncovering insights through data analysis, and solving problems end-to-end from concept to production."
