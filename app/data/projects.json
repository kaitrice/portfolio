This system was developed to support field research and data analysis, ultimately improving environmental monitoring and infrastructure planning.</p></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">My Role</h3><p>I led the frontend development and contributed to backend architecture. I built a responsive web interface to visualize sensor data in real time, integrated a scalable API layer to handle high-frequency data ingestion, and optimized database queries to support performance across large datasets.</p></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Challenges</h3><p>One of the key challenges was optimizing data flow between sensors and the dashboard while ensuring reliable real-time updates without overwhelming the server. We addressed this by implementing message queuing, aggressive caching, and efficient WebSocket communication.</p></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Impact</h3><p>The system is actively used in Navy-funded field deployments and helps researchers and engineers collect and interpret water/weather metrics with increased accuracy. It has enhanced responsiveness to environmental changes and provides a scalable foundation for future sensor expansion.</p></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Takeaways</h3><p>This project deepened my experience with real-time systems and highlighted the importance of designing for data efficiency and resilience in resource-constrained environments. It also reinforced the power of thoughtful UI/UX in communicating technical data clearly.</p></div></div>"

They wanted to promote music, tours, and social links from one centralized site without constant manual updates.</p><p>This was a solo freelance project built from scratch. I worked directly with the band, balancing their creative vision with performance and scalability needs, while keeping within a small budget and tight turnaround time.</p></div></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Approach</h3><div class=\"ms-2\"><p>I started by creating low-fidelity mockups to outline key content sections: music, video, events, and social links. Once approved, I:</p><ul class=\"list-disc ms-4 \"><li>Chose Next.js for static generation and easy routing</li><li>Used Tailwind CSS for rapid styling</li><li>Hosted on Vercel with custom domain setup</li><li>Built out both a public site and a hidden preview environment for stealth updates</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Challenges</h3><div class=\"ms-2\"><p>One of the key challenges was needing to manual update the website for every new release. I addressed this by using embedded links and APIs to platforms (Spotify, YouTube, Bandsintown) to automate content refresh without editing code.</p><p>Another challenge was the risk of breaking the live site during updates and getting pre-approval from all teammembers. To combat this I created a hidden, password-protected preview version of the site for internal review and testing.</p></div></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Impact</h3><div class=\"ms-2\"><ul class=\"list-disc ms-4 \"><li>Delivered a fast, lightweight site tailored to the band's style and needs</li><li>Enabled real-time content updates through integrations with streaming platforms</li><li>Provided a cost-effective, low-maintenance solution the band could own and grow with</li><li>Positive feedback from the band and their fans</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Takeaways</h3><div class=\"ms-2\"><p>This project deepened my confidence in creating full-stack solo solutions. I learned how to set up low-cost yet powerful infrastructure, and how to integrate dynamic third-party tools without bloating the codebase. In the future, I'd consider layering in a headless CMS if content demands grow.</p></div></div></div>"
