This system was developed to support field research and data analysis, ultimately improving environmental monitoring and infrastructure planning.</p></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">My Role</h3><p>I led the frontend development and contributed to backend architecture. I built a responsive web interface to visualize sensor data in real time, integrated a scalable API layer to handle high-frequency data ingestion, and optimized database queries to support performance across large datasets.</p></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Challenges</h3><p>One of the key challenges was optimizing data flow between sensors and the dashboard while ensuring reliable real-time updates without overwhelming the server. We addressed this by implementing message queuing, aggressive caching, and efficient WebSocket communication.</p></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Impact</h3><p>The system is actively used in Navy-funded field deployments and helps researchers and engineers collect and interpret water/weather metrics with increased accuracy. It has enhanced responsiveness to environmental changes and provides a scalable foundation for future sensor expansion.</p></div><div class=\"mb-3\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold\">Takeaways</h3><p>This project deepened my experience with real-time systems and highlighted the importance of designing for data efficiency and resilience in resource-constrained environments. It also reinforced the power of thoughtful UI/UX in communicating technical data clearly.</p></div></div>"
